Motivate Yourself by Noting Progress on Your Projects
========

I am the type of person who is motivated by a sense of accomplishment. I got A's
in school because it felt good to get A's. I feel motivated to contribute to
GitHub because of the contributions graph. I motivate myself at work by keeping
a [log](https://coderwall.com/p/nudgba) of the things I've accomplished. At
home, I have a wall of sticky notes to track progress on a variety of personal
projects.

I wanted an opportunity to learn more about UX, UI, Angular, Node, NoSQL
databases, and other things, and so decided to turn this sticky system at home
into a web application.

We'll have to see if it materializes.
